# DLG_YouTube-Downloader

### A YouTube Video and Playlist Downloader Using Pytube3 

##### This currently works in Linux!

Requirements :
1. Python 3.6 or above
2. FF-MPEG for post processing of high res downloads
2. Unix Terminal

This additionaly uses Pytube3 library so it would ask you to install pytube3.
The installation is automatic.

Steps to Use:

1. Clone this Repo
2. Open dlg.py and enter your default directory as the path variable on the top of the code.
3. Save and Run dlg.py
4. Enter the link and confirm.
5. The video will be downloaded at the default location!

Tip: While confirming the video/ playlist pressing a/A instead of y/Y will give you access to the **Advanced options** menu!

By default, it will download the highest resolution Progressive Video( Video and audio in a single file). It's usually is 360p.
So for downloading higher resolution video, go to the advanced options menu and select the resolution from the available.

For playlists it will always be the default untill in the near future we could change that :-).
