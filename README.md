# DLG_YouTube-Downloader

### A YouTube Video and Playlist Downloader Using Pytube3 

##### This currently works in Linux/Mac!

Requirements :
1. Python 3.6 or above
2. FF-MPEG for post processing of high res downloads
3. Unix Terminal
4. pip3 (That python external module downloader)

This additionaly uses Pytube3 library so it would ask you to install pytube3.
The installation is automatic.

Steps to Use:

1. Clone this Repo
2. Install modules from requirements.txt (Not actually required)
3. Run dlg.py on a fullscreen terminal
4. When run for the first time, it will ask for the default download location. Enter it.
5. Enter the link and confirm.
6. The video will be downloaded at the default location!

Tip: While confirming the video/ playlist pressing a/A instead of y/Y will give you access to the **Advanced options** menu!

By default, it will download the highest resolution Progressive Video( Video and audio in a single file). It's usually is 360p.
So for downloading higher resolution video, go to the advanced options menu and select the resolution from the available.

For changing the default download location, open path.txt file and change it or, just delete that file and rerun the program!

For playlists it will always be the default resolution untill in the near future we could change that :-).
